## Multicore Implementation of Crypto-Algorithm Using Network-on-Chip

Bachelor's thesis @ Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb


The thesis provides an overview of Network-on-Chip arcitecture for FPGA and a multicore implementation of Serpent cryptoalgorithm in Verilog. Serpent is a symmetrical cryptoalgorithm designed by Ross Anderson, Eli Biham and Lars Knudsen. Said algorithm was a finalist in the AES: the Advanced Encryption Standard competition (1997 - 2000).
